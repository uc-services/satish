                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">We live in a highly competitive era where all our career choices and our efforts determine the quality of our life in the future. The competition is increasing every day and has even engulfed the courses that were once called non-conventional. With this, the importance of proper career guidance and counselling can not be overlooked.
<br>
<br>A few years back, the largest number of students used to compete for mainstream courses like engineering, medical sciences, commerce, etc. other courses like arts, fine arts, hotel management, etc. were opted by selected few and hence getting admission was not a big deal. Today, even these courses have become hard to get and one has to compete with many students to get admission.
<br>
<br>The competition has become so brutal that there is no scope for mistakes in career. One small mistake can push you behind in the race towards your dreams. Nowadays, the career choices reflected by your resume is seen as the first impression of your decision-making skills. Hence, even a small, wrong career step can leave a bad impression.
<br>
<br>Today students are expected to be clear about their dreams and the career path leading towards it. This creates a lot of pressure among students and their parents who find themselves in a dilemma while choosing the right career. Professional career guidance service has come as a rescue for the students and parents. A good career guidance professional, not only directs you towards your dream but also gives you an end to end support in all the steps involved in it. With the number of colleges and prospective courses available, it is important that a student gets college and career guidance to find a better career.
<br>
<br>Problems faced by students and parents:
<br><strong>Lack of self-awareness</strong>: Your career choices should be your mirror image, you are the biggest ingredient for a successful career and hence it is very important to understand yourself before choosing a career. Unfortunately, a lot of students lack self-awareness and many times choose a career that doesn’t match their capabilities. Students might choose a college or career that is chosen by most of the people around, but it is not certain that it will be the best choice for them.
<br><br><strong>A plethora of Options:</strong> Electronics or Electrical engineering? Astrophysics or Astronomy? India or abroad? VIT or BITS? Confusion is bound to happen when you are surrounded by so many career and college choices. Finding the best college for the right career is even more difficult than finding a needle in a haystack.
<br>Facts Vs Propaganda: The internet is full of misleading information and it is easy to get misled by them. Many colleges make certain promises for advertisements or propaganda that are misleading and lots of students fall prey to it. It becomes very difficult to extract facts out of the propaganda. For instance, when a college proclaims 100 % placement, are they speaking about campus placement or outdoor placements, what is the average placement? These questions are rarely addressed in the college brochure.
<br><br><strong>Paper Puzzle:</strong> Filling the admission forms for colleges is almost like solving the toughest crossword puzzle. Once the student succeeds in shortlisting the colleges, then comes the herculean task of going through the admission and form filling procedure. Every college has a different admission procedure and requirement. There are many clauses and deadlines involved in the process and it becomes very difficult to keep a track of all of them. Missing one small deadline can result in losing a big opportunity.
<br>Sands of Time: The admission process deadlines are like sand clocks, the only problem being there are so many of them that if you try to hold one, the other might slip away. Many students do a big blunder of waiting for the results before applying. While most of the top college admissions start even before the pre-board exams. This makes the student lose out on many good colleges.
<br><br><strong>My Way and No Highway:</strong> Your neighbor’s son or daughter got huge success by choosing a certain career or college? It is not necessary that the same formula will apply to your son or daughter. Every kid is unique and has unique strengths, weaknesses, and requirements. When students get into a career or college that is not suitable for them, they might find it difficult to cope up with it and this might take them away from the success they deserve.
<br>
<br><strong>How Does College and Career Guidance Help?
</strong><br>There are a number of career options after 12th class. But the real challenge is to select the right one for you. Career guidance help students understand their strengths and weaknesses and then match them with their skills and interest so that they get the best suitable career choice.
<br>
<br>One wrong choice can not only cost a lot of money but also amount to waste of some precious years. Professional guides use modern scientific techniques like Career Assessment Test, etc. to find out the student’s strengths and weaknesses and then use these results to find a college or career.
<br>
<br>When dealing with a lot of options, the most logical solution is the process of strategic elimination. Professional career and college counselling help in narrowing down the options so that finding the right career or college becomes easy. Professional counsellors also empower you with certain information that is not available to general people. They deduce the facts about colleges or courses out of the advertisements so that the students don’t get misled.
<br>
<br>College and career counsellors keep a track of the form filling process for all the colleges. They guide the students and parents on how to deal with the form filling procedures and remind them of the deadlines from time to time so that the college admission process goes down smoothly. Most importantly, counsellors help you understand the uniqueness of the student and help in devising a unique career path specifically for the student so that he/she gets the most conducive atmosphere for steady growth and success in life. With a defined career path, the student gets the maximum output for his/ her efforts.
<br>
<br>To sum up
<br>Like I said in the beginning, it’s our efforts and career choices that determine the quality of our life in the future. College and career guidance can help you effectively in the career choice part, but there are no alternative efforts. When career guidance is fused with hard work, determination and perseverance can ensure a smooth path towards one’s dreams.</p>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">Career Counselling is a process that focuses on helping one understand one’s own self, as well as work trends, so that one can take an informed decision about career and education. Career Counselling helps manage a diverse range of problems such as low concentration levels to poor time management, trust issues with family to non-agreement between parents and children on which career to choose.
<br>
<br>In order to understand Career Counselling a little better, let us look at its most important elements:
<br>
<br><strong>A Qualified Career Counsellor
</strong><br>
<br>A genuine Career Counsellor is the essence of right guidance, which is why he/she is the most important element of any career counselling process. Career Counsellors are experts in psychology, which means that they should hold at least a post-graduate degree in Psychology/Applied Psychology, and/or a diploma in Counselling Psychology. Career Counsellors who give guidance for a particular field, such as engineering, management, hospitality, etc., must be experts in the concerned domain.
<br>
<br>A good Career Counsellor is a problem solver, a keen listener and observer, and has sufficient knowledge of various fields to guide you in your career decisions.
<br>
<br><strong>A Secure Environment
<br></strong>
<br>The process of career counselling involves creating a safe and secure environment, where the student feels at ease and is able to discuss his/her life and career, without any hesitation. A part of this secure environment is the assurance of confidentiality of the information shared by the student.
<br>
<br><strong>An Agreement Of Trust And Confidence
<br></strong>
<br>The Career Counselling process is based on a relationship of trust and confidence between the career counsellor and student. In order to help him/her, the counsellor may sometimes talk about their emotional and developmental issues, which can be a little stressful. The student and the parent needs to place an enormous amount of faith in the Counsellor to take care of such matters.
<br>
<br><strong>Relevant Psychometric Assessments
<br></strong>
<br>Psychometric Testing (Career Assessment) is a scientific and standardized process carried out to evaluate a person’s aptitude and personality. Psychometric assessments are a Counsellor’s tools, which are used to obtain the most important information about a student’s behavior, emotional strength, interests, and skills. This information helps to facilitate on what kind of careers would be suitable for him/her.

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">There are some common misconceptions about career counselling. Let us have a look at what career counselling is not:
<br>
<br><strong>It is not general advice about careers, courses and curriculum.
<br></strong>
<br>Career Counsellors help you pick the best career options, based on your abilities. Their suggestions and guidance are unbiased.
<br>
<br><strong>It is not a short-term process that gives instant results.
<br></strong>
<br>Career Counselling takes time, effort and patience. It is a long-term process involving many changes on the part of the student.
<br>
<br><strong>It is not a service that helps you get jobs or admissions in companies and colleges respectively.
<br></strong>
<br>Career Counsellors are not affiliated to any academic institution. They only help you reach your potential and aim for the best institutes and companies in your career.
<br>
<br><strong>It is not a procedure that runs on trial-and-error.
<br></strong>
<br>Career Counselling is a scientific process and involves making calculated moves, based on hard facts and methodical research.

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7"><strong>How can the tests help the students?
</strong><br><strong><br></strong>The traditional approaches to understanding personality traits never stressed the role of temperament or what is now called the emotional quotient (EQ). The EQ gets to relate a person to the situations around them and often the amount of volatility in the person’s temperament.
<br>
<br>As has been observed in the past, it is the calm individual who gets to be in better control of situations, no matter how acute and heated it might be. The ultimate question is what are the advantages of psychometric testing and is it really effective for the students?
<br>
<br>When the correct assessment of the individual’s EQ is made, it would be possible to guide him to a field that would be the best match for the kind of temperament. This brings stability to the career choice and in the very long term a better satisfaction in the chosen field. A mismatch in this aspect could cause acute distress to the person and more importantly affect the health to a large extent.
<br>
<br>Thus by using psychometric tests for school students well, it has become possible to guide the students towards making the right choice of career. It has helped many students realize what are their strengths and weaknesses. After taking a psychometric test, school students have really made better and informed career choices.<br><br><strong>Benefits of Psychometric testing
</strong><strong><br></strong><br>At present, there is no compulsion that school students need to undergo psychometric tests at any time during their study. However, psychometric tests for students are recommended so that the students can understand themselves and their capabilities better. It is thus more of a self-help and self-awareness step than a mandated study of the person.
<br>
<br>Thus the psychometric test for students must be performed with the due balance being exercised and to better guide the student and not as a mandatory requirement for studying a particular course. The advantages of psychometric testing are not only limited to a student finding their right career pathway but that they get to know their abilities and interests better which help them further in their career.<br></p>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">The perfect time for students to seek Career Counselling is during the ages 13-17 years (8th standard to 12th standard). This is a time of many changes taking place in their life, both physical and emotional, such as transitioning from school to college, and trying to “fit in” with peers. It is also a time when career decisions are made. This is why they need someone to guide them in the right direction at this time.
<br>
<br>Most of our parents are actively involved in shaping our career, in fact at least 51% of Indian parents’ priority is their child’s financial success (Survey by HSBC Retail Banking and Wealth Management in a report titled “ The Value of Education: Learning for Life”). We can safely assume that our parents follow a hands-on approach when it comes to making career decisions for us. Sometimes, it works and many a times, it does not. We can attribute this to the fact that every child is unique, and it is extremely hard for parents or teachers to always recognize the child’s strengths or weaknesses, and his passion or dislikes. This is another reason why career counselling is needed.
<br>
<br>For students in college, who are still confused about what they want to do, as well as for professionals who want to transition from their field to something they love, career counselling helps in the following manner:
<br>
<br>Career Counselling helps them understand the career options that they have, and how to pursue them.
<br>
<br>Career Counselling helps them understand their own strengths and weaknesses with regard to their present course or profession, and lets them know what career they would be suited for.
<br>
<br>Career Counselling gives them a platform to voice their opinion about what they would like to pursue, as well as discuss the obstacles that they may be worried about.
<br>
<br>Career Counselling makes the transition from one field to another a non-stressful event.
<br>
<br>Career Counselling helps give them the required confidence to change their domain, with the support of an experienced mentor.</p>
